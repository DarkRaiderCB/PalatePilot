    Follow these steps:
    1. Use the three provided dishes as the iconic dishes for {city}.
    2. Select appropriate restaurants from the provided information that serve these dishes.
    3. Generate a narrative for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, including restaurant names, addresses, dish descriptions, and how the weather influences the dining experience.
    4. Output the response as a JSON object with fields: 'city' (string), 'weather' (object with 'temperature' as a number, 'condition' as a string, 'dining' as a string), 'iconic_dishes' (array of three strings), and 'tour' (object with 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', each containing 'restaurant', 'address', 'dish', 'description', 'weather_consideration' as strings).
    
    Ensure the narrative is engaging, culturally relevant, and reflects the {dining_type} dining environment.
    Return only valid JSON with no extra text, backticks, or markdown formatting.
